# Sociology
Sociology is the planned and systematic study of human groups and human behaviour to provide rich insights of social life and provide recommendations for policy making. Comte defined it as the "Queen of Sciences", however the view that sociology is and ought to be studied like a natural science remains a controversial debate.
Opponents of this debate include Popper with his idea of falsification and Kunh with his notion of paradigms and the view of sociology being only a pre science due to its inductive nature.
